# GiphyApp

This app uses the Giphy API to retrieve .gifs associated with a certain keyword(either predetermined or user input) and display them for the user.  The images are displayed as still images until clicked, at which point they animate.  If the user hits their 'f' key while one or more images are animated, they will be added to a separate favorites area.
